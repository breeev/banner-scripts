# Banner Scripts

**Warning: Untested on Windows.** How can you make Windows banners anyway?

This repo will contain all my custom scripts for very special and useless banners.
They're designed to be compact and customizable. Made for laptops.

To use them, simply put them in a safe place and add their path in a file that's loaded by your shell when you open a terminal emulator.
For bash, you can use `bashrc` or `zshrc` for zsh.

For a list of available filenames for both shells, see:
